# Quick wins

Refactors ready to land when time allows; not blocking any feature, but would improve the codebase meaningfully.

This file is **one of four repo-local indexes** Claude reads on every session start (alongside `FEATURES.md`, `BUGS.md`, `PATTERNS.md`). Active entries are kept inline, organized under thematic `##` sections you invent as work emerges. When a quick win lands, append a shipped-note entry to [`QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md`](QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md); do not move it within this file. Negative-knowledge findings (approaches attempted and reverted) are first-class promotion candidates from the history into the relevant `.claude/patterns/<slug>.md` Cautionary tales sections.

Capture shorthand: name the refactor, describe the current smell in a sentence or two, sketch the preferred shape. A reader should be able to start work from the entry alone. Anchor entries on identifiers that survive refactors -- symbol names, entry titles, commit hashes, config keys -- never on line numbers, plan-phase ordinals, bullet positions, or temporal qualifiers ("new", "recent"): a precise locator that rots misleads harder than a coarse one that holds.

**After adding a new entry, run `/nightshift:ready`** from the repo root to confirm it parses as a quick-wins work item against the real grammar in `skills/ready/ready.js`. Quick wins carry no `**Requires:**` line; the failure mode to catch is an entry that doesn't parse as a `- ` bullet or `###` heading (ready reports it as a prose-only-section notice) while you can still fix it in the same session.

## Registration-time check

- **Reword or strengthen the smoke-call threshold in `README_CONSULTANT.md`.** Part two of the registration-time check treats an elapsed time over 100 seconds as establishing the long-running path, but exceeding 100 seconds only proves the client tolerates more than 100 seconds, not the full `TimeoutSeconds` ceiling (300 by default). Either present the criterion as the proxy it is (evidence that `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` overrode Claude Code's shorter built-in default) or extend the procedure to drive a call near the configured ceiling.
- **Add a correlation ID to the consultation lifecycle log lines.** The `Consultation started` and `Consultation completed` lines emitted by the `Consult` tool method in `Tools/Consultant.cs` share no correlation identifier, which is why the README's registration-time check pairs them by timestamp and imposes its single-in-flight precondition. Emit a short per-consultation ID in both lines (a logger scope or an explicit field), then drop the precondition from `README_CONSULTANT.md` in the same change.

## (add sections as work emerges)

## History

Implemented quick wins are archived in [`QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md`](QUICK_WINS_HISTORY.md), read only when consulted (not at session start) so the active backlog above stays scannable. When a quick win lands, append its entry there rather than to this file.
